# Assignment 9
# (I had to change the name of the file in order to get the file read properly.)

# Select a Class from our book or use the Class you created in a previous assignment. The class must have
# at least 2 methods.

# Write a test case for your class. Test the 2 methods. Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create
# a new instance of your class in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.


# My class from Lab 7. Please note that I had to adjust these classes to actually return something. The
# assert methods do not recognize printed statements. They need returned strings.
